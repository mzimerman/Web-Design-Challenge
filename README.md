Background
Create a Visualization Dashboard Website of Weather in 500+ World Cities Relative to the Equator at Different Latitudes Using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 4

Objectives
In building this dashboard, create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

Website Requirements
The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

A Landing Page containing:
An explanation of the project
Links to each visualizations page
C:\Users\mzimerma\Desktop\Data Analytics\Web Design\Web-Design-Challenge\Web-Design-Challenge\Index.html


Four Visualization Pages, each with:
A descriptive title and heading tag
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance


A Comparisons" Page that:
Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so that it can be easily visually compared
Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations
The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens


A Data Page that:
Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations
The table must be a Bootstrap table component
The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML


The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page
Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named Plots which provides links to each individual visualization page
Provides two more links on the right: Comparisons which links to the comparisons page, and Data which links to the data page
Is responsive (using Media Queries). The nav's background color must change
